# Input Verification

Inspired by WesBos [[link]](https://github.com/wesbos/javascript-verification-inputs)

## Goal

Pasting a text into any of the inputs, should fill all inputs with the appropriate character.

i.e.: 6 boxes. Pasting a six letter text should yield a result such as

* Text: string

* Expected Output: [ s ] [ t ] [ r ] [ i ] [ n ] [ g ]

Characters beyond the limit of boxes are to be ignored.
